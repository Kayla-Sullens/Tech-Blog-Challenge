## Description

This assignment was done to build a full-stack web application. It is very involved, since a user has different priveleges being logged in or not. Users also have to be able to add posts to their dashboard, view posts from others and add comments, was well as update or delete an existing post of their own. I've spent far too long on this assignment at this point, and I know it's not fully done. I will be working on other things and circling back to this.
